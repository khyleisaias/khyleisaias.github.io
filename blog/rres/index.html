                <br><i>In Hinduism, there is a distinction made between dharma and karma. Both are essential for the purpose of reaching moksha. Dharma (moral) is the cosmic law or moral principle that governs an individual’s conduct and Karma is the result of past, present and future actions. To achieve good karma (ethical), it is important to live according to dharma. Therefore, in terms of morality in Hinduism, there is an obligation to fulfil one’s destiny as prescribed by the cosmic principle. Karma, on the other hand, serves as the ethical principle in achieving this moral obligation. This distinction is observed in the dilemma, which is played out in the story of Krishna and Arjuna as expressed in the Bhagavad Gita.</i> <br />

                I realized that in all of the major world religions, Their are only one lesson: That you, the person in this world can do whatever you want to do, as long as it will bring peace and harmony in this world. Either that you are in different religions, the only thing that in common is that there are different ways to praise the ultimate reality and practice how to prase your ultimate reality.
